Hello! I am a first year PhD student at MIT advised by [Cathy Wu][cathy] and [Dylan Hadfield-Menell][dylan]. My high level research goal is to develop reinforcement learning (RL) agents that can learn, adapt, and co-operate in the real world.
I am interested in single-agent and co-operative multi-agent RL setups.  
Finally, I am also excited by the prospect of applying RL to solve real-world problems such as warehouse automation and traffic signal control. 

Previously, I have worked with [Lerrel Pinto][lerrel] at NYU on developing automatic curriculum learning methods for RL agents. Before that, I was a part of the [MARMot Lab][marmot] at NUS, where I worked with [Guillaume Sartoretti][guillaume] on applying multi-agent reinforcement learning to [traffic signal control][traffic] and [multi-agent pathfinding][mapf].
