Hello! I am a second year Ph.D. student at MIT, where I am part of the [Algorithmic Alignment Lab][dylan], advised by Dylan Hadfield-Menell. 

My high level research goal is to develop reinforcement learning (RL) systems that are aligned with human values and goals.
I am particularly interested in studying cooperation in multi-agent systems, which encompasses both pure agent teams as well as human-AI teams.
Finally, I am also excited by the prospect of applying RL to solve real-world problems such as warehouse automation and traffic signal control. 


Previously, I have worked with [Lerrel Pinto][lerrel] at NYU on developing automatic curriculum learning methods for RL agents. Before that, I was a part of the [MARMot Lab][marmot] at NUS, where I worked with [Guillaume Sartoretti][guillaume] on applying multi-agent reinforcement learning to [traffic signal control][traffic] and [multi-agent pathfinding][mapf].
