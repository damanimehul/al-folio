Hello! I am Mehul Damani, a final year undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering at NTU, Singapore. Currently, I hold concurrent research positions at the National University of Singapore and New York University. At NUS, I am a part of the Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Lab advised by Guillaume Sartoretti . At NYU, I am a part of the CILVR cluster advised by Lerrel Pinto. My research primarily lies at the intersection of reinforcement learning and robotics. 

### Research Interests 
I am amazed by the capabilities of the human mind and aspire to develop intelligent systems with the ability to generalize, adapt and evolve in the real world. I see my research encompassing the domains of machine learning (with a focus on reinforcement learning), vision and robotics. **My current topics of focus are - curriculum learning for reinforcement learning agents and multi-agent traffic signal control.**
