Hello! I am a second year PhD student at MIT. I am a part of the [Algorithmic Alignment Lab][dylan], where I am advised by Dylan Hadfield-Menell. 
My high level research goal is to develop reinforcement learning (RL) agents that can learn, adapt, and co-operate in the real world.
I am interested in both single-agent and co-operative multi-agent RL.  
I am also excited by the prospect of applying RL to solve real-world problems such as warehouse automation and traffic signal control. 
Finally, I am motivated by the general principle of designing AI systems that are aligned with the values we want to instill in them. 

Previously, I have worked with [Lerrel Pinto][lerrel] at NYU on developing automatic curriculum learning methods for RL agents. Before that, I was a part of the [MARMot Lab][marmot] at NUS, where I worked with [Guillaume Sartoretti][guillaume] on applying multi-agent reinforcement learning to [traffic signal control][traffic] and [multi-agent pathfinding][mapf].
